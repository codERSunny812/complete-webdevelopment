// now lets know about the operator in javascript 

// first let's know about uniary and binary operator

// uniary operator - which has single operand
// binary operator- which has two operand

var a=23;
var b=23;

var c=-a; //uniary operator

console.log(c);

var d=a+b;
console.log(d);

// we can also use binary operator in two string 

// now arithimatic operator 
//  just like in c , java it also has the same operator 

var x=2;
var y=3;

console.log("the sum of the number is "+(x+y))
console.log("the subtraction of the number is "+(x-y))
console.log("the multiplication  of the number is "+(x*y))
console.log("the division  of the number is "+(x/y))
console.log("the increment  of the number is "+(x++))
console.log("the increment  of the number is "+(++y))
console.log("the increment  of the number is "+(++x))
